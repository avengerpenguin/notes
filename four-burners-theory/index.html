    <h1>Four Burners&nbsp;Theory</h1>
    

    <p>The origins of this idea seem to be murky, but most people point to the <a href="https://jamesclear.com/four-burners-theory">James Clear article on the Downside of Work-Life Balance</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is that you visualise health, work, family and friends as four seperate burners on a gas hob. The belief is that you need to turn one off to be successful or perhaps even turn off two in order to be <em>really</em>&nbsp;successful.</p>
<p>This is presented as a hard constraint &#8212; there&#8217;s no easy workaround (e.g. a standing desk alone isn&#8217;t enough to maintain health while working). It&#8217;s part of a mentality that life is all about&nbsp;<a href="/trade-offs/">Trade-offs</a>.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>The options of how to deal with boil down&nbsp;to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep all four going and don&#8217;t excel in any of&nbsp;them</li>
<li>Outsource or delegate (or&nbsp;automate?)</li>
<li>Use constraints, prioritise and otherwise make better use of your time (automation can help here&nbsp;too)</li>
<li>Embrace the idea of <a href="/seasons-of-life/">Seasons of&nbsp;Life</a></li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Maintain all&nbsp;four</h3>
<p>Both James Clear and <a href="https://thenaturaledge.com/fourburners/">The Natural Edge</a> suggest you can burn all four at a mediocre heat, but I wonder if this is one of these areas where if you don&#8217;t choose the constraint, the constraint will choose&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>That is, if work draws all your focus, things like family and health start to get less attention, <em>whether you intended this to happen or not</em>.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then we absolutely should be intentional in which we choose to focus as letting one or two burners be compromised unintentionally is likely to incredibly&nbsp;negative.</p>
<p>Does this mean this option isn&#8217;t really an option? Or at least not a healthy&nbsp;one.</p>
<h3>2.&nbsp;Outsource</h3>
<p>James points out we outsource lots of things&nbsp;already:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dry&nbsp;cleaning</li>
<li>Cooking (when ordering&nbsp;takeaway)</li>
<li>Repairs</li>
<li>Childcare</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially the idea is that outsourcing keeps the <em>burner</em> running, but with you removed from the equation. This might not be fulfilling as just because your children are looked after, doesn&#8217;t mean that <em>you</em> are spending time with them. Also, if you manage to delegate all your work, you might not want to have days with nothing motivating to work&nbsp;on.</p>
<h3>3. Prioritise and&nbsp;Constrain</h3>
<p>Multiple articles talk about prioritising. An oft-cited approach is Greg McKeown&#8217;s <a href="/essentialism/">Essentialism</a> where you should cut out literally everything that isn&#8217;t absolutely essential to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>This is obviously something we should keep an eye on all the time, but what stands out from James Clear&#8217;s article is explicitly leveraging constraints to force you to be more&nbsp;efficient.</p>
<h3>4. Seasons of&nbsp;Life</h3>
<p>The concept here is to break your life into seasons. Rather than striving for a perfect balance of everything forever, you have periods where your focus is more on some things than&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/seasons/">Nathan Barry&#8217;s article on seasons</a>, they seem to be anything from a few weeks to a few years where you have a particular focus, but then that season comes to an&nbsp;end.</p>
<p>This appears to fit nicely with the idea of &#8220;less is more&#8221; as well as avoiding <a href="/trade-off-anxiety/">trade-off anxiety</a> where it&#8217;s hard to pick what to commit to, so you don&#8217;t commit to anything. If we know that &#8220;I&#8217;m doing this for the next 3 months&#8221; then we know things being traded off simply have to wait &#8212; you&#8217;re not dropping them&nbsp;altogether.</p>
