    <h1>Digital&nbsp;Gardening</h1>
    

    <p>The concept of a Digital Garden is explained well by both <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">Joel Hooks</a> and <a href="https://christiantietze.de/posts/2020/05/digital-gardening/">Christian Tietze</a>.</p>
<p>It is mainly a return to the idea of writing notes/posts that are evergreen, non-chronological (i.e. not a blog) and contain lots of interlinking and&nbsp;curation.</p>
<p>This is easily illustrated by looking at the idea of a Wiki (e.g. Wikipedia) where you have a single note/page per concept and you favour linking off to related&nbsp;concepts.</p>
<p>What makes this approach a garden (over, say, a stream or timeline) is that it&#8217;s ok to go back and update, expand on and grow the pages over&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>I have personally felt a lot of pressure with writing a complete blog post to make it well-structured, coherent and complete before&nbsp;publishing.</p>
<p>This leads to perfectionism and <a href="/analysis-paralysis/">analysis-paralysis</a> (particular for my <a href="/personality-type/">personality type</a>) that prevents me writing at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>I have always preferred this approach to my own blog, preferring punchy links such as <code>/what-is-devops/</code> for <a href="http://avengerpenguin.com/what-is-devops">my post on what I think DevOps is</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this since reading <a href="https://blog.doismellburning.co.uk/permalinks/">Kristian Glass&#8217;s 2015 article on preferring permlinks to having dates in URLs</a> and have configured static site generators like Pelican for some time to prefer&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>However, even in my own blog post above, I still have a date in the article and the default behaviour of many static site generators is for the homepage to be a stream of content rather than an <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/">old school home page</a>.</p>
<p>With the Digital Gardening approach, I plan to write more in the open and build daily habits to write&nbsp;more.</p>
