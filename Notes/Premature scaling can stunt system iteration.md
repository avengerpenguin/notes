This is a phrase I've lifted entirely from [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z2kr7QrJczqYyfwLFcv1FLEUMdVTsgfYSdFXA) which I've kept verbatim as it's a nice, punchy way of tying together various concepts I see as mistakes and [[anti-patterns]] in product and sofware development.

I see this as a summary various things that paint you into corners if you do not following them (or at least understand them):

* [[YAGNI]]
* [[Feedback Loops]]
* [[DevOps]] as a special case of leveraging feedback loops
