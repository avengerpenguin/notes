Notes from [article by [Rohan Kumar](https://seirdy.one/)](https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html).

The concept of "User Domestication" captures the idea not only do we know full well that many messaging or social networks:

* do not interoperate
* rely on that lack of compatibility to create a network effect where people need to join to speak to people they know

but also that this leads to an inevitible "domestication" where users are unable to resist or fight back when that company starts to do user-hostile things like violate privacy or force invasive advertising.
