## Takeaways

Quick:

* J never chaotic, P never lawful
* F always good, T never good
* I/E and S/N blur a lot

### Worldviews

* ST -> Evil except for ISTJ being neutral, so fairly evil (pragmatic worldview isn't good)
* SF, NF -> Good (so all F -> Good)
* NT -> Neutral except for ENTJ. True neutral when INT, but EJ makes it evil + lawful and EP makes it chaotic.

### Identities

* EJ is never chaotic
* IJ Generally neutral, never chaotic
* IP never lawful, varies via worldview as with EP
* EP is always chaotic (worldview drives how good or evil)

### Core Intelligences

* NP almost always chaotic except with INTP
* SP generally chaotic, good with F, evil/neutral with T
* SJ generally lawful, again neutral/evil with T, good with F
* NJ never chaotic, mostly neutral, good when with F, neutral/evil with T (so visionary role is quite independent, but F keeps it a good vision)

### Supplementary Intelligences

* TP never lawful, never good
* TJ generally lawful, never good
* FP entirely chaotic good (strong Fi all round?)
* FJ always good, mostly neutral (except ESFJ being the nicest one)

### Dominant Functions

* Ne brings the chaos
* Fe is good and lawful or neutral (never chaos)
* Ti is neutral -- evil when with Se, true neutral with Ne
* Te is lawful evil
* Se is chaotic -- evil with Ti, good with Fi
* Si is neutral good with Fe, lawful neutral with Te (compassion trumps rules or rules trump compassion)
* Ni is neutral -- true neutral with Te, neutral good with Fe
* Fi is chaotic good
