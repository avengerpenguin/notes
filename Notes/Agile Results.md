I came across [Agile Results on a Page](http://jdmeier.com/agile-results-on-a-page/) and [an interview on YouTube with J.D. Meier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-Fgn9UMAlM) which talks about an "Agile Results" system for getting meaningful results in life.

It essentially boils down to focus on a small number of things at a time -- just as with [[Essentialism]] -- but specifically:

1. Three wins for the day.
2. Three wins for the week.
3. Three wins for the month.
4. Three wins for the quarter.
5. Three wins for the year.

This isn't to be confused with the [[Agile Methodology]] but clearly has some overlap with it in that you focus on short term iteration, experiments, etc. with a focus on what you plan to get out of it, rather than just working through a list/backlog.
