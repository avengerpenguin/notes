Things to get that CI/CD feel locally:

* For written sites, having Obisidian git plugin regularly commit and push
* Use of "drafts" feature in Pelican allows for releasing a proper article later
* pre-commit pre-commit and pre-push hooks:
	* pre-commit: linting, formatting, etc.
	* pre-push: run tests, stage, verify, publish
