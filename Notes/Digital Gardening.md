The concept of a Digital Garden is explained well by both [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) and [Christian Tietze](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2020/05/digital-gardening/).

It is mainly a return to the idea of writing notes/posts that are evergreen, non-chronological (i.e. not a blog) and contain lots of interlinking and curation.

This is easily illustrated by looking at the idea of a Wiki (e.g. Wikipedia) where you have a single note/page per concept and you favour linking off to related concepts.

What makes this approach a garden (over, say, a stream or timeline) is that it's ok to go back and update, expand on and grow the pages over time.

I have personally felt a lot of pressure with writing a complete blog post to make it well-structured, coherent and complete before publishing.

This leads to perfectionism and [[analysis-paralysis]] (particular for my [[personality type]]) that prevents me writing at all.

I have always preferred this approach to my own blog, preferring punchy links such as `/what-is-devops/` for [my post on what I think DevOps is](http://avengerpenguin.com/what-is-devops).

I've been doing this since reading [Kristian Glass's 2015 article on preferring permlinks to having dates in URLs](https://blog.doismellburning.co.uk/permalinks/) and have configured static site generators like Pelican for some time to prefer this.

However, even in my own blog post above, I still have a date in the article and the default behaviour of many static site generators is for the homepage to be a stream of content rather than an [old school home page](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/).

With the Digital Gardening approach, I plan to write more in the open and build daily habits to write more.
