This is the start of a new daily log of what I'm doing, what I learn and other things worth recording for my own (poor) memory.

This may get more structured over time, but I am avoiding too rigid a template since
[[Premature scaling can stunt system iteration]].

Things I have learnt about today:

* The concept of [[Digital Gardening]]
* The [[Obsidian]] desktop app for linked markdown note-taking
