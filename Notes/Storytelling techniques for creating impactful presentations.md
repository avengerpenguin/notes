> Public speaking is not just speaking in public. It is storytelling.

## Foundation

### Message

"What do I want people to walk away knowing/thinking/feeling?"

Anticipate what might prevent that.

### Tone

Is this talk funny? Serious? Informative?

Match tone to the message. Don't use humour if announcing redundancies.

### Audience

To whom am I talking and what are their priorities?

## Story Structures

### Beginning

Hardest part.

- Find your narrative arc
- Define beginning and end
- Then fill in the middle

### Hero's Journey/Monolith

Hero leaves home for a difficult journey. Comes home with wisdom.

"My journey from high-school dropout to CEO of a fortune 500 company"

### The Mountain

Like hero's journey, but not always a happy ending. Building tensions, overcoming obstacles.

"I was born to a single mother in rural Mississippi and my hightest aspiration was to one day be a maid like my grandmother" - Oprah

### Nested Loops

Three or more narratives layered within eaqch other.

Core story at the centre and others elaborate on it. First story you being is the last you finish.

"Growing up, I fanced many obstacles... I had a 2nd grade teacher who taught me... What I learned was..."

Titanic:

- Old woman
- Jack and wossname

### Sparklines

Structure often contrast ordinary with extraordinary/ideal.

Steve Jobs: unveils iPhone. Talks about clunky reality of phones and paints a picture of what it could be.

- Inspirating the audience to action
- Creating hope and excitement
- Creating a following

"Imagine a world where deploys take 2s... What if tests took only 30s to write..."

MLK "I have a dream" -- contrasting dream world with reality.

### In Medias Res

Narrative begins in the heat of the action, then starts over at the beginning.

Good for short presentations.

- Grabs attention from the start.

"I never thought one semi-colon would cause the destruction of my company..."

### Converging Ideas

Structure that shows the audience how different strands came together.

"How did a philosopher, an English hacker, a CSS MAster and a db wizard come together to create of the biggest software success stories? Twice."

### False Start

Stat telling a predictable story, then disrupt.

- Disrupt expectations
- Show benefits of a flexible approach
- Keeping audience engaged

"I raised 15M in funding. Assembled a world class team. And after two years of hard work launched a visually stunning video game. But this isn't a story about success. This is a story about failure."

### Petal Structure

Organise multiple stories around central concept.

- Show how strands are interconnected
- Showing how several scenarions relate back to one idea

Uses repetition like as with Sparklines.

> What is Slack so successful?
> - One of a kind innovation (IRC, Hipchat)
> - Brilliant founders? (MS, Google)
> - Good timing? (Palm, Yahoo)

## Key takeaways

### Find your purpose

"If someone walked over to your desk and asked you to explain what you were working on, could you?"

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it.

You can be confident if it's aligned with your purpose.

### Find your emotions

"The best speakers speak from the heart. It is not about what they say, it is about how they make you feel."

### Find your composure

Nerves are normal.
