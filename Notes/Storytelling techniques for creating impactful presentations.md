## Foundation

### Message

"What do I want people to walk away knowing/thinking/feeling?"

Anticipate what might prevent that.

### Tone

Is this talk funny? Serious? Informative?

Match tone to the message. Don't use humour if announcing redundancies.

### Audience

To whom am I talking and what are their priorities?

## Story Structures

### Beginning

Hardest part.

- Find your narrative arc
- Define beginning and end
- Then fill in the middle

### Hero's Journey/Monolith

Hero leaves home for a difficult journey. Comes home with wisdom.

"My journey from high-school dropout to CEO of a fortune 500 company"

### The Mountain

Like hero's journey, but not always a happy ending. Building tensions, overcoming obstacles.

"I was born to a single mother in rural Mississippi and my hightest aspiration was to one day be a maid like my grandmother" - Oprah

### Nested Loops

Three or more narratives layered within eaqch other.

Core story at the centre and others elaborate on it. First story you being is the last you finish.

"Growing up "
