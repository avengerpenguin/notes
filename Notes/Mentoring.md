## Jargon

Jargon is a shortcut to comms. Useful only if there's a prior understanding.

## How

- Build trust -- Confidence
- Assume infinite intelligence, zero knowledge

## Remove Roadblocks

- Fear -- safe environment, learning as a value
- Imposter Syndrome -- Celebrate accomplishments, Reflect on progress, Keep a brag book

## Formulate Good Responses

- Encouraging
- Walk the middle path -- not too much info, but not too little
- Non-directive

## Bad Responses

- Well, actually...
- It's easy
- Just XYZ... (directive -- prefer "when this happens, I recommend...")

## Don't know?

Hit pause -- Go away and get a valuable response -- say "I don't know"

Show how to use resources to find things out.

## Mentor Better

- Self care -- take breaks, know your limits, be comfortable saying "no"
- Cultural and personal sensitivities -- personal space, acknowledge and appreciate differences

## Outlive the relationship

- Ask for feedback

## Other situations
