<h2>Foundation</h2>
<h3>Message</h3>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>What do I want people to walk away&nbsp;knowing/thinking/feeling?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anticipate what might prevent&nbsp;that.</p>
<h3>Tone</h3>
<p>Is this talk funny? Serious?&nbsp;Informative?</p>
<p>Match tone to the message. Don&#8217;t use humour if announcing&nbsp;redundancies.</p>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>To whom am I talking and what are their&nbsp;priorities?</p>
<h2>Story&nbsp;Structures</h2>
<h3>Beginning</h3>
<p>Hardest&nbsp;part.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find your narrative&nbsp;arc</li>
<li>Define beginning and&nbsp;end</li>
<li>Then fill in the&nbsp;middle</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hero&#8217;s&nbsp;Journey/Monolith</h3>
<p>Hero leaves home for a difficult journey. Comes home with&nbsp;wisdom.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>My journey from high-school dropout to <span class="caps">CEO</span> of a fortune 500&nbsp;company&#8221;</p>
<h3>The&nbsp;Mountain</h3>
<p>Like hero&#8217;s journey, but not always a happy ending. Building tensions, overcoming&nbsp;obstacles.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I was born to a single mother in rural Mississippi and my hightest aspiration was to one day be a maid like my grandmother&#8221; -&nbsp;Oprah</p>
<h3>Nested&nbsp;Loops</h3>
<p>Three or more narratives layered within eaqch&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>Core story at the centre and others elaborate on it. First story you being is the last you&nbsp;finish.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Growing up, I fanced many obstacles&#8230; I had a 2nd grade teacher who taught me&#8230; What I learned&nbsp;was&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Titanic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Old&nbsp;woman</li>
<li>Jack and&nbsp;wossname</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sparklines</h3>
<p>Structure often contrast ordinary with&nbsp;extraordinary/ideal.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs: unveils iPhone. Talks about clunky reality of phones and paints a picture of what it could&nbsp;be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspirating the audience to&nbsp;action</li>
<li>Creating hope and&nbsp;excitement</li>
<li>Creating a&nbsp;following</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Imagine a world where deploys take 2s&#8230; What if tests took only 30s to&nbsp;write&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="caps">MLK</span> &#8220;I have a dream&#8221; &#8212; contrasting dream world with&nbsp;reality.</p>
<h3>In Medias&nbsp;Res</h3>
<p>Narrative begins in the heat of the action, then starts over at the&nbsp;beginning.</p>
<p>Good for short&nbsp;presentations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grabs attention from the&nbsp;start.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I never thought one semi-colon would cause the destruction of my&nbsp;company&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<h3>Converging&nbsp;Ideas</h3>
<p>Structure that shows the audience how different strands came&nbsp;together.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>How did a philosopher, an English hacker, a <span class="caps">CSS</span> MAster and a db wizard come together to create of the biggest software success stories?&nbsp;Twice.&#8221;</p>
<h3>False&nbsp;Start</h3>
<p>Stat telling a predictable story, then&nbsp;disrupt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disrupt&nbsp;expectations</li>
<li>Show benefits of a flexible&nbsp;approach</li>
<li>Keeping audience&nbsp;engaged</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I raised 15M in funding. Assembled a world class team. And after two years of hard work launched a visually stunning video game. But this isn&#8217;t a story about success. This is a story about&nbsp;failure.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Petal&nbsp;Structure</h3>
<p>Organise multiple stories around central&nbsp;concept.</p>
<ul>
<li>Show how strands are&nbsp;interconnected</li>
<li>Showing how several scenarions relate back to one&nbsp;idea</li>
</ul>
<p>Uses repetition like as with&nbsp;Sparklines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is Slack so successful?
- One of a kind innovation (<span class="caps">IRC</span>, Hipchat)
- Brilliant founders? (<span class="caps">MS</span>, Google)
- Good timing? (Palm,&nbsp;Yahoo)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Key&nbsp;takeaways</h2>
<h3>Find your&nbsp;purpose</h3>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>If someone walked over to your desk and asked you to explain what you were working on, could&nbsp;you?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t explain it simply, you don&#8217;t understand&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>You can be confident if it&#8217;s aligned with your&nbsp;purpose.</p>
<h3>Find your&nbsp;emotions</h3>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The best speakers speak from the heart. It is not about what they say, it is about how they make you&nbsp;feel.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Find your&nbsp;composure</h3>
<p>Nerves are&nbsp;normal.</p>
