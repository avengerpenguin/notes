    <h1>Muse&nbsp;Roles</h1>
    

    <p>The &#8220;Muse&#8221; is a nickname for the role you play when you engage with your opposing shadow&nbsp;function.</p>
<h2>Ni - Epihany (<span class="caps">ENTP</span> and <span class="caps">ENFP</span>)</h2>
<p>Where you use internal intuition to fill in gaps in your tertiary function. This will be starting to piece together things you didn&#8217;t see before in social situations (Fe for <span class="caps">ENTP</span>) or in your ability to systemise and execute your plans (Te for <span class="caps">ENFP</span>)</p>
<h2>Ne - Curiosity (<span class="caps">INFJ</span> and <span class="caps">INTJ</span>)</h2>
<p>The Ni dominant function is really good at generating insights for the auxhiliary function (Fe for <span class="caps">INFJ</span>, Te for <span class="caps">INTJ</span>), but it might not serve well for their tertiary (Ti for <span class="caps">INFJ</span>, Fi for <span class="caps">INTJ</span>). Here, flirting with a brief moment of Ne-driven curiosity (research for the <span class="caps">INFJ</span>, reading or via relationships for <span class="caps">INTJ</span>) can provide insights that the Ni isn&#8217;t naturally inclined to&nbsp;intuit.</p>
