    <p>Notes from <a href="https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html">article by [Rohan Kumar](https://seirdy.one/)</a>.</p>
<p>The concept of &#8220;User Domestication&#8221; captures the idea not only do we know full well that many messaging or social&nbsp;networks:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not&nbsp;interoperate</li>
<li>rely on that lack of compatibility to create a network effect where people need to join to speak to people they&nbsp;know</li>
</ul>
<p>but also that this leads to an inevitible &#8220;domestication&#8221; where users are unable to resist or fight back when that company starts to do user-hostile things like violate privacy or force invasive&nbsp;advertising.</p>
