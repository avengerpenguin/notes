    <h1>Agile&nbsp;Results</h1>
    

    <p>I came across <a href="http://jdmeier.com/agile-results-on-a-page/">Agile Results on a Page</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-Fgn9UMAlM">an interview on YouTube with <span class="caps">J.D.</span> Meier</a> which talks about an &#8220;Agile Results&#8221; system for getting meaningful results in&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>It essentially boils down to focus on a small number of things at a time &#8212; just as with <a href="/essentialism/">Essentialism</a> &#8212; but&nbsp;specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Three wins for the&nbsp;day.</li>
<li>Three wins for the&nbsp;week.</li>
<li>Three wins for the&nbsp;month.</li>
<li>Three wins for the&nbsp;quarter.</li>
<li>Three wins for the&nbsp;year.</li>
</ol>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to be confused with the <a href="/agile-methodology/">Agile Methodology</a> but clearly has some overlap with it in that you focus on short term iteration, experiments, etc. with a focus on what you plan to get out of it, rather than just working through a&nbsp;list/backlog.</p>
